# ImpressCMS Bulma theme template
A bulma-based theme template for ImpressCMS. Use this to kick-start your ImpressCMS themes based on Bulma.io, a small, efficient and easy to use CSS framework.

BulmaCSS (https://www.bulma.io) is a modern, efficient CSS framework that gives a solid foundation, without including too much and becoming bloated. The download size is a fraction of Bootstrap 5 and page rendering is blazing fast.
## Choices
### Lean
This template should be as lean as possible
### Generic
This is a template, so make choices that are as generic as possible. If something will not be usefull for the majority of derived themes, do not include it.
### Use modern image standards
Use SVG and WebP where possible. Both have ample browser support and offer either better quality (SVG) or smaller files (AVIF).
### Prioritize framework constructs
Most of the commercial themes that are for sale at the moment are not leveraging the framework to the fullest, resulting in re-inventing the wheel on several occasions. The Unify3 theme will be based as much as possible on standard Bulma elements, reducing maintenance and code that needs to be sent to the browser.
