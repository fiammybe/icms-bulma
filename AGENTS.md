## Overview

This document outlines the high-level setup and structure of the ImpressCMS theme using the Bulma framework. The theme is designed to be responsive, flexible, and user-friendly, providing a solid foundation for building dynamic websites.

### Key Components

1. **Bulma Framework**: The theme uses the Bulma CSS framework for its responsive design and styling components.
2. **ImpressCMS**: The theme is built on top of the ImpressCMS content management system, providing a solid foundation for building dynamic websites.
3. **Admin Panel**: An admin panel is provided for managing site content and settings, using a dropdown navigation menu. The admin panel is generated by theme_admin.html.
4. **Blocks**: The theme uses blocks to organize content. Blocks are defined in the ImpressCMS admin panel, and the theme provides block zones to display them. Blocks have separate templates in src/modules/<module>/blocks/<block>.html.
5. **Templates**: The theme uses templates to define the structure of different parts of the website. Modules come with their own templates, and the theme provides a way to override them by re-defining the template file. Templates can have the .html or the .html.tpl extension. 

### Directory Structure

The theme is organized into the following directories:

- `.github`: Contains configuration files for GitHub Actions (e.g., workflows for continuous integration).
- `snippets`: Contains pages with specific tests, such as a calendar badge or a inbox message interface.
- `src`: Contains the main source code of the theme, including:
    - `assets`: Stores static assets such as images and fonts.
    - `modules`: Houses various modules of the ImpressCMS site for which the theme has specific templates
      - `blocks`: Houses the block templates for the modules
    - `templates`: Includes generic HTML templates for different parts of the website (e.g., header, footer, pages).

### Files

- **README.md**: Provides an overview of the project and its setup instructions.
- **theme.html**: The base template file that is used by ImpressCMS to render the theme. This file is a Smarty template.
  - this theme renders the contents of different block zones, and the main content of the page is rendered by the <{$icms_contents}> tag. 
- **theme_admin.html**: The base template file that is used by ImpressCMS to render the admin panel. This file is a Smarty template. 

### Dependencies

The theme relies on the following dependencies:

- **Bulma**: For styling and responsiveness. Use the CDN version of Bulma in theme.html.
- **ImpressCMS**: The content management system that powers the website. The theme is built on top of ImpressCMS.
- **Smarty**: The template engine used by ImpressCMS. The theme uses Smarty templates to render the theme. ImpressCMS uses <{ and }> as default delimiters.
- **AlpineJS**: For adding interactivity to the admin panel.


### Setup Instructions

To set up this ImpressCMS theme, follow these steps:

1. Deploy the theme to your ImpressCMS installation:
    - Copy the files from the `src` directory into your ImpressCMS theme directory.
    - Update any necessary configuration files (e.g., `theme.html`, `adminmenu.html.tpl`) to reference the new theme files.

### Customization

To customize the theme, you can:

- Modify the HTML templates in the `templates` directory.
- Update the CSS styles using Bulma. Adhere as much as possible to the Bulma constructs. Where possible, re-define Bulma CSS variables in the style.css file instead of adding !important statements.
- Add custom AlpineJS JavaScript for additional interactivity.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively set up and maintain this ImpressCMS theme, leveraging the power of Bulma CSS to create a modern and responsive website.
